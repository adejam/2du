### Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adejam/2du.git

```

```

To run StyleLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

npm run lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
npm run lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

and to have it actually fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
npm run format
```

You can also check against HTML Validator:

```bash

```

You can also build with webpack:
